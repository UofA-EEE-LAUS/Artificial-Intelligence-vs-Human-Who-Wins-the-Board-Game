UNDERSTANDING TIC TAC TOE USING MINIMAX ALGO:

Consider:
	player - the player who has the current turn to play
	board - the array which stores the state of the game
1. Set two variables:
	ai - for AI player; opponent - enemy;
1. A function to find if a given state is winning-> isWinning(board,player)
2. A function to find the available choices -> GetAvailableMoves(board)
3. Minimax function - Minimax(board,player) as:

	Minimax()
	{
		if(opponent wins)
			return -10
		else if(AI wins)
			return 10
		else if(game is draw (no available moves))
			return 0	
	}
